# The format of this file is:
#  - Comment lines start with '#'
#  - Description of each paramater start with ';' 
#     (These will be used by the maintenance program and must appear before the value)
#
#  - Main title description lines start with ';;' 
#     (Placed in maintenance screen hdr and must be first)

#  - Values start with a alphabetic variable name followed by an equal sign and value

#  - Validation rules should be included before any variable and start with a $
#    Rules have two forms:  
#         $RULE=..... which apply standard iNomads validation processing or comma sep list of values
#         $LIST=..... indicates a drop box with the values from file/directory
#                      (When a directory the file names are converted to 
#                       lowercase if directory starts with *)
#         $TBL=...  Can be provided if a $LIST supplied to define translation values

#                     left before drawing the unformatted input line

#    Both may be provided.  These will be used by the maintenance program
